# Run Stanford Alpaca AI on your machine

## Overview

Stanford Alpaca is an open-source language model developed by computer scientists at Stanford University (**1**). It is a seven-billion parameter variant of Meta's LLaMA model (**2**), which has been fine-tuned using supervised learning on 52,000 instruction-following demonstrations (**3**). Alpaca is designed to be able to respond to instructions like ChatGPT (**4**), and it has been demonstrated to perform similarly to the ChatGPT model on many tasks but at a lower cost. The goal of the Alpaca project is to build and share an instruction-following language model with the research community, which can serve as a platform for further research and development.
